# Calculate-WAIS-holocene-accumulation-from-airborne-radar
This project contains the codes used to calculate holocene accumulation from airborne radar layers over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet

This folder contains a series of MATLAB codes used in Bodart et al. (xxx) to calculate holocene accumulation from airborne radar layers over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

Details on the accumulation 1-D modelling methods can be found at: Fahnestock et al. (2001; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1065370); MacGregor et al. (2009; https://doi.org/10.3189/172756409789097441); MacGregor et al. (2016; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aab1702); and Waddington et al. (2007; https://doi.org/10.3189/002214307784409351).

Note: Some of the codes archived here are modified versions of codes compiled by Joe MacGregor (NASA) and Mark Fahnestock (UAF) and which are available at the GitHub page of Joe MacGregor (https://github.com/joemacgregor/layer_analysis). 

The output from these codes were used to produce the analysis found in the paper. To cite the code + data output, refer to the associated manuscript: Bodart et al. (xxx).
