# Calculate WAIS holocene accumulation from airborne radar

This folder contains a series of MATLAB codes used in Bodart et al. (2023; The Cryosphere; https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2022-199) to calculate holocene accumulation from airborne radar layers over the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

A summary of the key findings from this study is provided as follows:

"Using a spatially extensive IRH over Pine Island Glacier, Thwaites Glacier, and Institute and Möller Ice Streams (covering a total of 610 000 km2 or 30% of the WAIS), and a local layer approximation model, we infer mid-Holocene accumulation rates over the slow-flowing parts of these catchments for the past ~4700 years. By comparing our results with modern climate reanalysis models (1979 – 2019) and observational syntheses (1651 – 2010), we estimate that accumulation rates over the Amundsen-Weddell-Ross divide were on average 18% higher during the mid-Holocene than modern rates. However, no significant spatial changes in the accumulation pattern were observed."
